Feature:
    In order to see who a LAN's attendees are, and how many there are
    As a LAN organiser (and an attendee)
    I need to see a list of attendees for any given LAN

    Scenario: When a user logs in during a LAN, they will be added to the LAN's attendee list

    Scenario: When a user logs in and there is no LAN occurring, they will not be added to any LAN's attendee list

    Scenario: When a user has attended one or more LANs, the LAN names show on their profile
